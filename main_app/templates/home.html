        There’s nothing quite like the joy of gathering with friends over a table full of 
        homemade dishes, each one infused with love, memories, and a touch of personal flair. 
        FeastMode is about more than just meals; it's are a celebration of togetherness, a chance to 
        slow down and truly connect. In our fast-paced world, where scheduling dinners can feel 
        like a logistical nightmare, potlucks offer a beautifully simple solution. Everyone 
        contributes, everyone enjoys, and no one carries the weight of hosting alone. 
        From hearty family recipes to last-minute store-bought treats (because, let’s be real, 
        we’ve all been there), every dish tells a story, and every gathering strengthens bonds. 
        Whether it’s a cozy get-together with lifelong friends or a welcoming space to meet 
        new faces, FeastMode is here to remind us that sharing food is one of the most genuine ways to 
        nurture relationships.

    <div>At FeastMode, our goal is to help make hosting easier, more organized, and stress-free. 
        Say goodbye to endless text chains and forgotten dishes! Our app streamlines the planning 
        process, allowing guests to sign up for what they’ll bring, see what’s still needed, and 
        coordinate seamlessly with the group. Whether you’re organizing a casual Sunday brunch, 
        a themed dinner party, or a community feast, our app ensures that everything comes together 
        effortlessly. Now, instead of worrying about menu gaps or duplicate dishes, you can focus 
        on what really matters—enjoying good food, laughter, and meaningful moments with your 
        favorite people. Hosting a potluck has never been easier, and bringing friends together 
        has never been more fun!

    <h2>How FeastMode works:</h2>
        <p>FeastMode takes the stress out of organizing a potluck by making the process seamless and 
            user-friendly. Here’s how it works:</p>
        <ul class="app-list">
            <li><span>Create a Party</span> – The host sets up the potluck event in the app and gets a unique party code.</li>
            <li><span>Send the Code</span> – Share the code with guests so they can easily join the party.</li>
            <li><span>Sign Up & RSVP</span> – Guests can confirm their attendance and see what’s needed.</li>
            <li><span>Claim or Add a Dish</span> – The host can propose dishes, and guests can claim an option or add their own contribution.</li>
            <li><span>Describe Your Dish</span> – Guests can enter details about their dish, including ingredients and allergens, 
                so everyone knows what to expect.</li>
            <li><span>Enjoy a Stress-Free Potluck</span> – With everything organized in one place, you can focus on the fun, not the logistics!</li>
        </ul>
